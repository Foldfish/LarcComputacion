**This applications uses Android Studio and Firebase**

This application was created as part of a school project for a small-medium company; I would like to clarify that this is not the final product but a Beta, I added the basic functionalities which include:

-Login window
-Create a new user
-Create a new request
-Update information such as address and phone number
-Show the requests made by the user.

The main purpouse of this application is for the user to create requests for a service in a specific date and time.
